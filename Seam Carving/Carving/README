Note that the video is made in gif format. To view this, you may have to view in a browser like Chrome or Safari. 

The GIF allows different size frames. 

However, the GIF was perhaps not a great format too since the image is being distorted and stretched because there is no zero padding even though the image is getting smaller. 

This problem would not have existed if we had added zero paddding when we removed pizels from a row or column.
